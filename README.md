# Mythic Realms

**Mythic Realms** is a full tabletop roleplaying system designed for long-form campaigns, high-power play, and living worlds that extend beyond mortal limits.

This system is built to support epic-scale storytelling: empires rise and fall, gods walk the world, economies matter, and power has consequences. Mythic Realms is not a ruleset for short adventures or disposable characters—it is a framework for legends.

## Core Pillars

### Epic Progression
- Character advancement extends to **Level 30**
- Epic tiers introduce new mechanics, not just larger numbers
- Power growth shifts from personal skill to mythic influence
- High-level characters reshape the world around them

### Mythic Spellcasting
- Spell tiers extend beyond conventional limits
- Access to **10th–15th level spells**
- High-tier magic alters reality, history, and cosmology
- Spell progression emphasizes rarity, consequence, and narrative weight

### Expanded Threat Scale
- Challenge Ratings extend far beyond mortal danger
- Apex monsters redefine battlefields and regions
- Divine and titanic entities exist on a separate scale of conflict
- Not all threats are meant to be defeated—some must be survived, negotiated with, or endured

### Living Economies
- Gold and resources are no longer abstract
- Taxation, tribute, and upkeep vary by culture and environment
- Surface realms, subterranean societies, warrens, and city-states operate under different economic pressures
- Wealth creates political gravity and narrative tension

### Restored and Reforged Creatures
- Forgotten creatures return to the world
- Existing monsters are rebuilt to reflect believable ecology and danger
- Mundane wildlife is resilient, territorial, and reactive
- Every creature exists as part of a wider ecosystem

## Design Philosophy

Mythic Realms follows three guiding principles:

1. **Consistency Over Simplicity**  
   Rules exist to reinforce the internal logic of the world.

2. **Myth Over Math**  
   Numbers serve narrative weight, not the other way around.

3. **Choice With Consequence**  
   Power is never free—every advantage reshapes the world.

This system assumes tables that value immersion, long-term play, and meaningful progression. It is intentionally deep, modular, and uncompromising.
